## Project Description:

### Goal:

The project aims to create an interactive login form page, enabling users to log in, register a new account, and recover a lost password.

### Feature Description:

- **Login Form:** Users can enter their login credentials to access their account.
- **Registration:** New users can create an account by providing necessary information.
- **Password Recovery:** Users who forgot their password can recover access through a password reset procedure.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Login Form:** Fields for email address and password, "Login" button.
- **Registration:** Form with fields for email address, password, password confirmation.
- **Password Recovery:** Password reset procedure using email address.
- **Error Messages:** Display error messages in case of incorrect data.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Security:** Application of appropriate security standards for data transmission and storage.
- **Responsiveness:** The page should be adapted for various devices.
- **Aesthetics:** Pleasing interface, providing positive user experience.
- **User-Friendliness:** Intuitive interface, easy to use for users.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- *Email address input field*
- *Password input field*
- *"Login" button*
- *Link "Register"*
- *Link "Forgot Password?"*
- *Registration Form: Fields for email, password, password confirmation*
- "Register" button*
- *Password Recovery Form: Field for email*
- "Reset Password" button*

### Site Map:

- *Home Page*: Login form and links to registration and password recovery.
- *Registration Page*: Registration form and link to return to the login form.
- *Password Recovery Page*: Password recovery form and link to return to the login form.

## System Architecture:

### Technologies:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly using a framework, e.g., React).
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express framework or another suitable language and framework.
- **Database:** MongoDB or another suitable database.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of individual form functions.
- **Interface Tests:** Ensure that the interface works correctly on different devices.
- **Security Tests:** Check resistance to attacks, verify the application of security standards.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React for more advanced features).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (or another framework), database (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Security:** Use of HTTPS protocols, password hashing.

### Code Structure:

- *Directories/Files*: Separate files for the logic of login, registration, password recovery forms.
- *Code Writing Style*: Clear comments, modular structure.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of individual form functions.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check user interaction on different devices.
- **Security Tests:** Verify the system's resistance to intrusion attempts.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each form function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, corrections, publication on the production server.
- **Dates:** Determine dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels with users for problem reporting.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user feedback and needs.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide tasks into specific activities (e.g., interface design, function implementation, testing).
- **Dates:** Specify the time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours of work or a team of developers.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, external services, possible fees for technical support.
